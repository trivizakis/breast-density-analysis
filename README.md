# Breast Density Analysis: DDSM & mini-MIAS
The Deep Learning component for breast density classification.

<b>Abstract.</b> Potentially suspicious breast neoplasms could be masked by high tissue density, thus increasing the probability of a false‑negative diagnosis. Furthermore, differentiating breast tissue type enables patient pre‑screening stratification and risk assessment. In this study, we propose and evaluate advanced machine learning methodologies aiming at an objective and reliable method for breast density scoring from routine mammographic images. The proposed image analysis pipeline incorporates texture [Gabor filters and local binary pattern (LBP)] and gradient‑based features [histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) as well as speeded‑up robust features (SURF)]. Additionally, transfer learning approaches with ImageNet trained weights were also used for comparison, as well as a convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed CNN model was fully trained on two open mammography datasets and was found to be the optimal performing methodology (AUC up to 87.3%). Thus, the findings of this study indicate that automated density scoring in mammograms can aid clinical diagnosis by introducing artificial intelligence‑powered decision‑support systems and contribute to the ‘democratization’ of healthcare by overcoming limitations, such as the geographic location of patients or the lack of expert radiologists.
